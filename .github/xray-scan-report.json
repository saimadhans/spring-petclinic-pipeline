It allows you to apply security constraints directly on methods (which represent web application endpoints) using annotations such as: `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize` and more.\n\nThe core of the vulnerability lies in how the Spring Framework's `MergedAnnotations` API resolves annotations on methods within a type hierarchy that uses unresolved generics. For example, if a method with a security annotation is defined in a generic interface or superclass, and its child class or interface doesn't explicitly resolve the generic type, the Spring Framework might fail to detect the annotation.\n\nThe most significant impact of this vulnerability is the potential for authorization bypass in applications that use Spring Security's `@EnableMethodSecurity` feature. If an application's security is based on annotations and methods in a generic class hierarchy, this flaw could cause the security check to be incorrectly skipped.\n\nFor example, a developer might place a security annotation like `@PreAuthorize` on a method within a generic superclass. Due to the vulnerability, a call to the overridden method in a child class could bypass the security check, allowing an unauthorized user to execute the method's logic. This can lead to a denial of service or, in a worst-case scenario, authorization bypass.\n\n\nVulnerable code example:\n\n```\nimport org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;\n\n// 1.

Tomcat acts as a Java HTTP web application server, although it is not a full JEE application server.\nMultipart requests are a standard way for web clients to send data to a server when the data consists of multiple distinct parts. The most common type is `multipart/form-data`, used for file uploads in HTML forms.\n\nTomcat's `HTTP Connector` handles incoming `HTTP POST` requests and parses the different parts of the request. Once Tomcat has completed this initial parsing, it makes the parsed parts available to the Java web application code via the standard Servlet API, most commonly through `HttpServletRequest.getParts()`. The application then retrieves part objects, each representing an individual field or file from the multipart request.\n\nTo limit how these requests consume the memory on the server, Tomcat configures the use of `maxParameterCount` that is responsible to limit the total number of HTTP parameters in a request. The single `maxParameterCount` limit doesn't accurately reflect the disproportionately higher memory cost associated with parsing and retaining the headers of each individual multipart `part` compared to a simple URL-encoded parameter.\n\nAn attacker can craft a specially designed multipart `HTTP POST` request, containing an extremely large number of individual multipart parts where each of these parts can be very small.
