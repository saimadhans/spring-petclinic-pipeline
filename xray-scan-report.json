Tomcat acts as a Java HTTP web application server, although it is not a full JEE application server.\nMultipart requests are a standard way for web clients to send data to a server when the data consists of multiple distinct parts. The most common type is `multipart/form-data`, used for file uploads in HTML forms.\n\nTomcat's `HTTP Connector` handles incoming `HTTP POST` requests and parses the different parts of the request. Once Tomcat has completed this initial parsing, it makes the parsed parts available to the Java web application code via the standard Servlet API, most commonly through `HttpServletRequest.getParts()`. The application then retrieves part objects, each representing an individual field or file from the multipart request.\n\nTo limit how these requests consume the memory on the server, Tomcat configures the use of `maxParameterCount` that is responsible to limit the total number of HTTP parameters in a request. The single `maxParameterCount` limit doesn't accurately reflect the disproportionately higher memory cost associated with parsing and retaining the headers of each individual multipart `part` compared to a simple URL-encoded parameter.\n\nAn attacker can craft a specially designed multipart `HTTP POST` request, containing an extremely large number of individual multipart parts where each of these parts can be very small. The overhead of handling a vast quantity of distinct headers for the different parts leads to rapid resource exhaustion on the server, which can result in a denial of service on the server.\n\nThe fixed versions introduce new `maxPartCount` and `maxPartHeaderSize` attributes to limit  the maximum total number of parts and the maximum size of a `part`'s header.","jfrog_research_severity":"High","jfrog_research_severity_reasons":[{"name":"The prerequisites for exploiting the issue are either extremely common or nonexistent (always exploitable)","description":"The web application deployed on the vulnerable Tomcat server must expose an endpoint that is configured to accept and process multipart requests, which is common for applications that allow file upload and web form functionalities.","is_positive":false},{"name":"The issue results in a severe impact (such as remote code execution)","description":"The vulnerability may lead to a denial of service.","is_positive":false},{"name":"The issue can be exploited by attackers over the network","description":"A remote attacker can trigger a denial of service by sending a crafted HTTP POST request over the network to the exposed web application running on the vulnerable Tomcat server.","is_positive":false}]},"applicability":null,"applicability_details":[{"component_id":"docker://spring-petclinic:latest","source_comp_id":"","vulnerability_id":"CVE-2025-48988","result":"not_covered"}],"component_physical_paths":["sha256__ea38e4c46af189f4492e1affcae4dea0dfc90e319b3534195533571dc145e42d.tar.gz/app/app.jar/META-INF/sbom/application.cdx.json/org.springframework.samples:spring-petclinic:3.5.0-SNAPSHOT/gav:/org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core:10.1.41/org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core:10.1.41","sha256__ea38e4c46af189f4492e1affcae4dea0dfc90e319b3534195533571dc145e42d.tar.gz/app/app.jar/BOOT-INF/lib/tomcat-embed-core-10.1.41.jar"]},{"issue_id":"XRAY-704764","summary":"Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.  When using PreResources or PostResources mounted other than at the root of the web application, it was possible to access those resources via an unexpected path.
